This program was written to experiment with TWGL, a linear algebra library for javascript and to implement a simple painters algorithm.
The program supports rotating between all of the targets on the screen by pressing the target button and you can move the camera around by pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard. I have only tested this with google chrome.
