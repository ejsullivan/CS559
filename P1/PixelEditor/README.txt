This is a pixel image editor program. For the editor to work the entire grid needs to fit on the screen.
It has only been tested with Google Chrome. 

To use it just select a color from the drop down menu and then click on the block that you want 
to change to that color. You can turn the grid on/off by clicking the GRID ON/OFF button.
The grid can be cleared by pressing the CLEAR button. The grid will be filled with random 
colors by pressing the RANDOM button.

I have included an example image that was made with this program in the submission.
