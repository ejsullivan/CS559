This program was written to experiment with TWGL, a linear algebra library for javascript.
The program supports rotating between all of the targets on the screen by pressing the target
button and you can move the camera around by pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard.
The program could be improved by actually drawing the objects in the correct order so
elements of the world that are behind another element are not drawn in front.
I have only tested this with google chrome.
